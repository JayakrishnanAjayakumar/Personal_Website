Jayakrishnan Ajayakumar is a Research Associate in the Department of Population and Quantitative Health Sciences at the School of Medicine in Case Western Reserve University.  His research is focused on spatial computing with a particular emphasis on developing efficient and scalable software solutions to synthesize and contextualize fine-scale spatial data from a variety of sources such as Spatial Videos, Spatial Video Geonarratives, and geo-spatial social media platforms. Along with spatial computing, he is also interested in utilizing parallel computation for solving data challenges related to spatial big data and in developing novel methodologies for preserving spatial confidentiality. He is also the lab manager for GIS Health & Hazards Lab at Case Western Reserve University.
