abstract: Exposure to ambient air pollution is increasingly recognized as a major driver of morbidity and mortality.1 Ambient air pollution is anticipated to increase as a result of climate change, extreme weather events and wildfires.2,3 Within the United States, disparities already exist in exposure to air pollution. Residing in a nonwhite majority or low-income census tract is associated with increased exposure to fine particulate matter [PM ≤2.5μm in aerodynamic diameter (PM2.5)].4 The pattern of air pollution exposure among other vulnerable populations has yet to be established. Individuals experiencing homelessness represent a growing population in the United States, with over half a million people homeless in 2020.5 Among this group, an increasing proportion experience unsheltered homelessness—defined as residence in the street or in a structure not intended for human habitation.6 These individuals are uniquely vulnerable to the impact of worsening air quality, particularly outside of large urban centers, where access to indoor shelters may be limited.7 We hypothesize that in addition to global air pollution, individuals experiencing unsheltered homelessness are exposed to excess air pollution as a result of proximity to stationary and mobile sources. By considering this potential exposure at the local level, our aim was to provide a broad estimate of exposure, and develop a framework of local-level geospatial analysis that can be used to guide further targeted research and intervention.
